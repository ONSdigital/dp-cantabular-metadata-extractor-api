# cant-recipe-service-auth-florence.md

This will create a recipe for a pre-defined query in sandbox florence.

The correct SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN will need to be set in the environment via
`export SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN=XXX`

The correct value for sandbox can be found via

```
cd dp-configs/secrets/sandbox 
gpg -d zebedee.json.asc|grep SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN|awk '{print $2}'
```

Use the script like

`./cant-recipe-service-auth-florence.sh -id TSXXX`

The TSXXX has to be present in a list generated by `./makerecp -list` 

The recipe is "used up" by our journey and I suggest maintaining a list in
google docs (contact SteveM for the link) or checking by search for `RTT` in
florence in the "datasets" tab.

The script generates titles like `RTT: Legal partnership status(TS002) 20220928-1352:43`
